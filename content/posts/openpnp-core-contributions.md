## The Objective
Improve the reliability and precision of the OpenPnP (Open Source Pick and Place) ecosystem for industrial-grade PCB assembly.

## The Problem
Sub-millimeter precision in robotics requires a perfect marriage of computer vision and motion control, which often suffers from latency and jitter in open-source implementations.

## The Liquidation
* **Vision Pipeline Optimization:** Contributed to the core logic that handles part alignment and feeder calibration.
* **Architectural Guidance:** Collaborated on global-scale robotics code to ensure cross-platform stability.
* **Community Leadership:** Provided "Fixer" level insights to resolve edge-case bugs in complex motion profiles.

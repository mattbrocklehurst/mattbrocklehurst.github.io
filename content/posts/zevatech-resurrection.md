## The Objective
Restore a decommissioned Zevatech Pick-and-Place machine to modern operational standards by bypassing obsolete, proprietary control logic.

## The Problem
The original hardware relied on undocumented, closed-source logic boards and legacy communication protocols that were no longer serviceable. 

## The Liquidation
* **Protocol Breaching:** Reverse-engineered the proprietary signal logic to understand the mechanical intent of the original designers [cite: 2025-12-25].
* **Logic Transplant:** Designed and implemented a modern firmware layer to interface with the original motor drivers and solenoids [cite: 2025-12-25].
* **Modern Integration:** Successfully bridged the 1990s-era mechanics to a modern PC-based control system via custom C++ logic.

## Matt Brocklehurst | Systems Surgeon

**Senior R&D Systems Architect specializing in "Impossible" problems where software hits hardware.**

I provide high-leverage technical liquidation for complex systems. Whether it is rescuing undocumented legacy hardware or architecting high-performance rendering engines for global scale, I bridge the gap between low-level engineering and enterprise reliability.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

* **System Modernization:** Reverse-engineering and resurrecting obsolete hardware (Zevatech, Legacy ECUs).
* **High-Performance C++:** Architecting deterministic rendering and low-latency audio kernels.
* **Mass-Scale Reliability:** Proven track record with 50,000+ units deployed on resource-constrained PIC hardware.
* **Full-Stack Hardware:** Multi-layer PCB design (Altium/Pulsonix) and ARM/RTOS firmware development.

## 🚀 Featured Missions

* **SDL2 Mainline Fix:** Liquidated a kernel-level thread synchronization deadlock in the Win32 event loop.
* **DIBThread Rendering:** Architected a high-frequency rendering kernel for 60FPS deterministic display.
* **OpenPnP Core:** Modernizing computer vision and motion control for open-source SMT assembly.
